  label: Who We Are
  headline: |
    A different kind of
    *acquirer.*
  paragraphs:
    - Most buyers see businesses as assets to extract value from. We see them differently — as communities of people, relationships built over years, and reputations earned through hard work.
    - When we acquire a business, we're making a long-term commitment. To the employees who depend on it. To the customers who trust it. To the founder who built it. We don't flip. We steward.
    - Kairos is built on the belief that the right moment — and the right partner — can turn a transition into a legacy.
